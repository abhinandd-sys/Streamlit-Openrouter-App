Basic application showcasing my skill with creation of simple AI chat interface using Openrouter.ai API.

![](FrontPage.png)

Using Openrouter api and streamlit created a simple chat interface allowing the user to chat with the any AI provided by the Openrouter.ai website,
This might require you to bring your own API Key from Openrouter website.

**Expected Outcome**: Building a simple AI Chatbot connecting the Openrouter.ai API Interface with Streamlit as frontend.

Possibilities for growth:
- Building a personal assistant
- Building a emotional supporting partner with AI
- Building a academic supporting partner for your upcoming assignments
- And more possibile application...
